## my-articles-admin

Hey Hi,
This repo is the backend of my-blog. I have hosted it on Heroku and create the API of my all Blogs. Later with the help of [Blog Repo](https://github.com/samaranand/blogs) I created frontend for [https://samaranand.github.io/blogs/](https://samaranand.github.io/blogs/)

**Feel free to contribute or point out any issue.**

> `npm run dev` will run code at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), you can [mail-me](mailto:samarss2015@gmail.com) to learn about environment variables that I used.

#### Thanks Alot for giving your time
